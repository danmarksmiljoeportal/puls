# Getting Started
This tutorial demonstrates how to auto-generate a C# client SDK for PULS using the OpenAPI v3 specification. Open source and commercial tools for client/server SDK generation are available for the most popular programming languages, e.g. https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen.

## 1. Download and install NPM (Node Package Manager)

## 2.. Install NSwag CLI (Command Line Interface) from NPM

Open your terminal and enter the following command to install NSwag on your system globally.
